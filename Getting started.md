# Getting started

## Conference system

1. Schedule
2. Statistics/Logging
3. Dispatch (pick up speakers at the airport)

## Adding a dependency

1. Clone project one (schedule)
2. Add docker-compose with Postgres
3. Show GUI
4. Show db

## Works on my machine

1. Show msg in RabbitMQ
2. Clone dispatcher
3. Short walktrhough of dispatcher
4. Create docker-compose at solution level
5. Run the solution
6. Show GUI -> dispatcher
7. Clone stats/Logging
8. Modify docker-compose
9. Run
10. Show Kibana

## Language agnostic

1. Short walkthrough of schedule
2. Why Django?

## Config

1. POSTGRES_USER + POSTGRES_PASSWORD + POSTGRES_DB
2. Links
3. Pointers to links
4. Port mapping (which is which?)

## Independent releases

1. Build and push docker image for logger
2. Reason about that independent release
